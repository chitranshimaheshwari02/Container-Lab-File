Lab Experiments Included
## Experiment 1 — Virtual Machines vs Containers

This DevOps-focused experiment presents a comparative study of Virtual Machines and Containers using the following technologies:

- Ubuntu

- VirtualBox

- Vagrant

- Docker

- Nginx

### The experiment highlights:

- Infrastructure provisioning techniques

- VM-based deployment processes

- Containerized application execution

- Architectural differences in terms of isolation, resource utilization, and performance

## Experiment 2 — Docker Installation & Container Lifecycle

## This experiment introduces the core concepts and practical usage of Docker, including:

- Pulling Docker images from repositories

- Running containers with port mapping

- Accessing and verifying services via a web browser

- Handling and resolving port conflicts

- Managing the container lifecycle (start, stop, remove commands)

## Experiment 3 — Custom Docker Images (Ubuntu & Alpine-Based NGINX)

## This experiment demonstrates how to build and deploy custom Docker images using different Linux base distributions while running NGINX inside containers.

- Base Images Used:

- Ubuntu 22.04

- Alpine Linux

- Key learning outcomes include:

- Writing Dockerfiles for custom image creation

- Installing and configuring NGINX inside containers

- Building Docker images with custom tags

- Running multiple containers using different port mappings

- Comparing image size and performance between Ubuntu and Alpine

- Understanding optimization using lightweight container images

- Implementation Details:

Official NGINX container → Port 8080

Ubuntu-based custom container → Port 8081

Alpine-based custom container → Port 8082
